                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>Hypertext Markup Language (<span class="html-text">HTML</span>) is the standard markup language for
                    creating web pages and web
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>Web browsers receive <span class="html-text">HTML</span> documents from a web server or from local
                    storage and render the documents into
                    multimedia web pages. <span class="html-text">HTML</span> describes the structure of a web page
                    semantically and originally included
                    cues for the appearance of the document.
                </p>
                <p><span class="html-text">HTML</span> elements are the building blocks of <span
                        class="html-text">HTML</span> pages. With <span class="html-text">HTML</span> constructs, images
                    and other objects such
                    as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="html-text">HTML</span>
                    provides a means to create structured
                    documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
                    quotes
                    and other items. <span class="html-text">HTML</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using
                    angle brackets. Tags such as
                    <span class="tag">&lt;img /&gt;</span> and <span class="tag">&lt;input /&gt;</span> directly
                    introduce content into the page.
                    Other tags such as <span class="tag">&lt;p&gt;</span> surround and provide information about
                    document text and may
                    include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the <span class="html-text">HTML</span>
                    tags, but use them to interpret the
                    content of the page.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="block-2">
                <h2>Markup</h2>
                <p><span class="html-text">HTML</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called
                    tags (and their attributes),
                    character-based data types, character references and entity references. <span
                        class="html-text">HTML</span> tags most commonly come
                    in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are
                    unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is
                    the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
                </p>
                <p>Another important component is the <span class="html-text">HTML</span> document type declaration,
                    which triggers standards mode
                    rendering.</p>
                <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>
                <div>
                    <pre class="code">
                        <span>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
                        <span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
                                <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
                                        <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>This is a title<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
                                <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
                                <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
                                        <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Hello world!<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
                                <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
                        <span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
                    </pre>
                </div>
            </div>
